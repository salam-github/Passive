# Passive
passive data gathering tool


You are going here to create your first passive recognition tool, you have the choice of language, however your program will have to recognize the information entered (FULL NAME, IP, @login).

For the case of the full name, it will have to recognize the entry: "Last name" and "First name", and then look in the directories for the telephone number and the address.

If it is the IP address, your tool should display at least the city and the name of the internet service provider.

If it is a username, your tool will have to check if this username is used in at least 5 known social networks.

The result should be stored in a result.txt file (result2.txt if the file already exists)

information should be gathered from a public resource.
for usernames the program should check if the user is present in at least 5 social networks
